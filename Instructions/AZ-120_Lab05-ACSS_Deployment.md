### Task 1: Address the vCPU requirements in the target Azure subscription

>**Note**: You do not need to complete this task if you have already implemented all of [the AZ-120 lab prerequisites](https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/AZ-120-Planning-and-Administering-Microsoft-Azure-for-SAP-Workloads/blob/master/Instructions/AZ-120_Lab00_Prerequisites.md).

>**Note**: To complete this lab (as described), you will need a Microsoft Azure subscription with the vCPU quotas that accommodate deployment of the following VMs:

- 2 x Standard_E4ds_v4 (4 vCPUs and 32 GiB of memory each) or 2 X Standard_D4ds_v4 (4 vCPUs and 16 GiB of memory each) VMs for the ASCS tier
- 2 x Standard_E4ds_v4 (4 vCPUs and 32 GiB of memory each) or 2 X Standard_D4ds_v4 (4 vCPUs and 16 GiB of memory each) VMs for the application tier 
- 2 x Standard_M64ms (64 vCPUs and 1750 GiB of memory each) VMs for the database tier

>**Note**: To minimize the vCPU and memory requirements for the database VMs, you can change the VM SKU to Standard_M32ts (32 vCPUs and 192 GiB of memory each).

1. From the lab computer, start a Web browser, and navigate to the Azure portal at `https://portal.azure.com`.
1. In the Azure Portal, select the **Cloud Shell** icon and start a PowerShell session in Cloud Shell. 

    > **Note**: If this is the first time you are launching Cloud Shell in the Azure subscription you will be using in this lab, you will be asked to create an Azure file share to persist Cloud Shell files. If so, accept the defaults, which will result in creation of a storage account in an automatically generated resource group.

1. In the Azure portal, in the **Cloud Shell** pane, at the PowerShell prompt, run the following (if needed, replace `eastus` with the name of the Azure region to which you intend to deploy resources in this lab):

    > **Note**: To identify the names of Azure regions, in the **Cloud Shell**, at the Bash prompt, run `(Get-AzLocation).Location`
     
    ```powershell
    Set-Variable -Name "Azure_region" -Value ('eastus') -Option constant -Scope global -Description "All processes" -PassThru

    Get-AzVMUsage -Location $Azure_region | Where-Object {$_.Name.Value -eq 'standardEDSv4Family'}
    
    Get-AzVMUsage -Location $Azure_region | Where-Object {$_.Name.Value -eq 'standardDSv4Family'}

    Get-AzVMUsage -Location $Azure_region | Where-Object {$_.Name.Value -eq 'standardMSFamily'}

    Get-AzVMUsage -Location $Azure_region | Where-Object {$_.Name.Value -eq 'cores'}
    ```

1. Review the output to identify the current vCPU usage and the vCPU limit. Ensure that the difference between them is sufficient to accommodate vCPUs of Azure VMs that you will be deployed in this lab. Take into account both VM family-specific and total regional vCPU numbers. 
1. If the number of vCPUs is not sufficient, close the Cloud Shell pane, in the Azure portal, in the **Search** text box, search for and select **Quotas**.

1. On the **Virtual machines** tab, specify the following settings:

    |Setting|Value|
    |---|---|
    |Generate Recommendation based on|**SAP Application Performance Standard (SAPS) - Select this option to provide SAPS for application tier and Database Memory size and click Generate Recommendations**|
    |SAPS for application tier|**10000**|
    |Memory size for database (GiB)|**1024**|

1. Select **Generate Recommendation**.
1. Review the size and the number of VMs for the ASCS, application, and database virtual machines. 

    >**Note**: If needed, adjust the recommended sizes by selecting the **See all Sizes** link for each set of virtual machines and choosing an alternative size. By default, the distributed deployment type with high availability as well as the application tier SAPS and database memory size specified above results in the following VM SKU recommendations:
    - 2 x Standard_E4ds_v4 for the ASCS VMs (4 vCPUs and 32 GiB of memory each)
    - 2 x Standard_E4ds_v4 VMs for the application VMs (4 vCPUs and 32 GiB of memory each)
    - 2 x Standard_M64ms for the database VMs (64 vCPUs and 1750 GiB of memory each)

    >**Note**: To minimize the vCPU and memory requirements for the database VMs, consider changing the VM SKU to Standard_M32ts (32 vCPUs and 192 GiB of memory each).

    >**Note**: If needed, you can request quota increase by selecting the **Request Quota** link for a specific SKU of virtual machines and submitting a quota increase request. The processing of a request typically takes a few minutes.

    >**Note**: Azure Center for SAP solutions enforces the usage of the SAP supported VM SKUs during deployment.

1. On the **Virtual machines** tab, in the **Data disks** section, select the **View and customize configuration** link.
1. On the **Database disk configuration** page, review the recommended configuration without making any changes and select **Close**.
1. Back on the **Virtual machines** tab, select **Next : Visualize Architecture**.
1. On the **Visualize Architecture** tab, review the diagram illustrating the recommended architecture and select **Review + create**.
1. On the **Review + create** tab, wait for the validation process to complete, select the checkbox confirm that you have ample quota available in the deployment region to avoid running into "Insufficient Quota" error, and select **Create**.
1. When prompted, in the **Generate new key pair** window, select **Download private key and create resource**.

    >**Note**: The private key required to connect to the Azure VMs included in the deployment will be downloaded to the computer from which you are running this lab.

    >**Note**: Wait for the deployment to complete. This might take about 25 minutes.

>**Note**: Following the deployment, either proceed to installing SAP software by using Azure Center for SAP solutions or delete the lab resources by following instructions in the next task.

### Task 2: Delete the Azure resources provisioned in this lab

>**Important**: The cost of the resources you deployed is significant, so ensure that you deprovision the lab if you don't intend to use it beyond this point. Deleting the virtual instance for SAP solutions will not delete the underlying infrastructure resources. To delete the resources, you should use the procedure described in this task, which targets resources in three resource groups:

- **Contoso-SAP-C1S**
- **CONTOSO-VNET-RG**
- **ACSS-DEMO**

1. On the lab computer, in the Microsoft Edge window displaying the Azure portal, select the **Cloud Shell** icon and start a PowerShell session in Cloud Shell. 

    > **Note**: If this is the first time you are launching Cloud Shell in the Azure subscription you will be using in this lab, you will be asked to create an Azure file share to persist Cloud Shell files. If so, accept the defaults, which will result in creation of a storage account in an automatically generated resource group.

1. In the Azure portal, in the **Cloud Shell** pane, at the PowerShell prompt, run the following commands to stop and deallocate all Azure VMs deployed in this lab:

    ```powershell
    $resourceGroupName = 'Contoso-SAP-C1S'
    $vms = Get-AzVM -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroupName
    foreach ($vm in $vms) {
       Stop-AzVM -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroupName -Name $vm.Name -Force 
    }
    ```

1. At the PowerShell prompt, run the following commands to detach all data disks from all Azure VMs deployed in this lab:

    ```powershell
    foreach ($vm in $vms) {  
       $vmDisks = $vm.StorageProfile.DataDisks
       foreach ($vmDisk in $vmDisks) {
          Remove-AzVMDataDisk -VM $vm -Name $vmDisk.Name
       }
       Update-AzVM -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroupName -VM $vm -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
    }
    ```

1. At the PowerShell prompt, run the following commands to enable the delete option for network interfaces and disks attached to all Azure VMs deployed in this lab:

    ```powershell
    foreach ($vm in $vms) {
       $vmConfig = Get-AzVM -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroupName -Name $vm.Name
       $vmConfig.StorageProfile.OsDisk.DeleteOption = 'Delete'
       $vmConfig.StorageProfile.DataDisks | ForEach-Object { $_.DeleteOption = 'Delete' }
       $vmConfig.NetworkProfile.NetworkInterfaces | ForEach-Object { $_.DeleteOption = 'Delete' }
       $vmConfig | Update-AzVM
    }	
    ```

1. At the PowerShell prompt, run the following commands to delete all Azure VMs deployed in this lab:

    ```powershell
    foreach ($vm in $vms) {
       Remove-AzVm -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroupName -Name $vm.Name -ForceDeletion $true -Force
    }
    ```

1. At the PowerShell prompt, run the following commands to delete the **Contoso-SAP-C1S** resource group and all of its remaining resources:

    ```powershell
    Remove-AzResourceGroup -Name 'Contoso-SAP-C1S' -Force -AsJob
    ```

1. At the PowerShell prompt, run the following commands to delete the **CONTOSO-VNET-RG** resource group and all of its remaining resources:

    ```powershell
    Remove-AzResourceGroup -Name 'CONTOSO-VNET-RG' -Force -AsJob
    ```

1. At the PowerShell prompt, run the following commands to delete the **ACSS-DEMO** resource group and all of its remaining resources:

    ```powershell
    Remove-AzResourceGroup -Name 'ACSS-DEMO' -Force -AsJob
    ```

    >**Note**: The last three command execute asynchronously (as determined by the -AsJob parameter), so while you will be able to run the next PowerShell command immediately afterwards within the same PowerShell session, it will take a few minutes before the resource groups and their resources are actually removed.
