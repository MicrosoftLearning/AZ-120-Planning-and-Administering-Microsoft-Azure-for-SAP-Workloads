## Instructions

### Exercise 1: Implement the minimum prerequisites for evaluating deployment of SAP workloads in Azure by using Azure Center for SAP solutions

Duration: 30 minutes

In this exercise, you implement the minimum prerequisites for evaluating deploying SAP workloads in Azure by using Azure Center for SAP solutions. This includes the following activities:

>**Important**: The prerequisites implemented in this exercise are *not* meant to represent the best practices for deploying SAP workloads in Azure by using Azure Center for SAP solutions. Their purpose is to minimize time, cost, and resources required to evaluate the mechanics of deploying SAP workloads in Azure by using Azure Center for SAP solutions and performing post-deployment management and maintenance tasks. Implementing the prerequisites includes the following activities:

- Creating a Microsoft Entra user-assigned managed identity to be used by Azure Center for SAP solutions for Azure Storage access during its deployment.
- Granting the Microsoft Entra user-assigned managed identity that is used to perform the deployment access to the Azure subscription and the Azure Storage General Purpose v2 account
- Creating the Azure virtual network that hosts all of the Azure virtual machines included in the deployment.
- Creating and configuring a network security group (NSG) that is used to restrict outbound access from subnets of the virtual network that hosts the deployment.
- Creating and configuring a NAT gateway that will allow for outbound connectivity from Azure VMs that are part of the deployment.

These activities correspond to the following tasks of this exercise:

- Task 1: Create a Microsoft Entra user-assigned managed identity
- Task 2: Configure Azure role-based access control (RBAC) role assignments for the Microsoft Entra ID user-assigned managed identity

#### Task 2: Implement prerequisites for disaster recovery of SAP workloads managed by Azure Center for SAP solutions 

>**Note**: While Azure Center for SAP solutions service is a zone redundant service, there is no Microsoft initiated failover in the event of a region outage. To remediate such scenario, you should configure disaster recovery for SAP systems deployed using Azure Center for SAP solutions by following guidance described in [Disaster recovery overview and infrastructure guidelines for SAP workload](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sap/workloads/disaster-recovery-overview-guide), which involves the use of Azure Site Recovery (ASR). In this task, you'll step through the process of implementing an ASR-based disaster recovery solution which relies on that guidance.

>**Note**: ASR is the recommended solution for application servers and SAP Central Services instances. For database servers, you should consider using native their replication functionality.

1. On the lab computer, in the Microsoft Edge window displaying the Azure portal, in the **Search** text box, search for and select **Recovery Services vaults**.
1. On the **Recovery Services vaults** page, select **+ Create**.
1. On the **Basics** tab of the **Create Recovery Services vault** page, specify the following settings (leave others with their default values) and select **Next: Redundancy**.

   |Setting|Value|
   |---|---|
   |Subscription|The name of the Azure subscription used in this lab|
   |Resource group|The name of a **new** resource group **acss-dr-RG**|
   |Vault name|**acss-dr-RSV**|
   |Region|the name of the Azure region that is paired up with the ACSS-registered SAP deployment|

   >**Note**: To identify the region which is a paired up with the one hosting your production workloads, refer to MS Learn documentation describing [Azure paired regions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/reliability/cross-region-replication-azure#azure-paired-regions).

1. On the **Redundancy** tab, specify the following settings and select **Next : Vault properties**

   |Setting|Value|
   |---|---|
   |Backup Storage Redundancy|**Locally-redundant**|

1. On the **Vault properties** tab, review the **Enable immutability** setting without enabling it and select **Next : Networking**
1. On the **Networking** tab, accept the default option to **Allow public access from all networks** and select **Review + create**
1. On the **Review + create** tab, wait for the validation process to complete and select **Create**.

   >**Note**: Do not wait for the provisioning process to complete but instead proceed to the next step. The provisioning might take about 2 minutes.

   >**Note**: Now you will set up the disaster recovery environment in the paired up region in which you created the Recovery Services vault. This environment will include a virtual network that will host replicas of the Azure VMs currently hosted in the primary region where you provisioned Virtual Instance for SAP. 

1. On the lab computer, in the Microsoft Edge window displaying the Azure portal, in the **Search** text box, search for and select **Recovery Services vaults**.

   >**Note**: You could provision at this point both Azure Bastion and Azure Firewall, however you should instead automate their provisioning as part of your disaster recovery failover procedure. This will minimize charges associated with maintaining the disaster recovery environment. The same should apply to other components of that environment that mirror the configuration of the primary Virtual Instance for SAP, such as Azure Premium file shares and custom routing.

#### Task 3: Review monitoring options for SAP workloads managed by Azure Center for SAP solutions

>**Note**: As with backup, you will not be able to fully experience the monitoring capabilities of Azure Center for SAP solutions. This requires installation of SAP software or registering an existing Azure Monitor for SAP solutions instance. Instead, in this task, you will step through the interface available in the Virtual Instance for SAP solutions to identify and review these capabilities.

1. On the lab computer, in the Microsoft Edge window displaying the Azure portal, in the **Search** text box, search for and select **Virtual Instances for SAP solutions**. 
1. On the **Virtual Instances for SAP solutions** page, review the summarized status information for the **VI1** instance, including the overall health and status visual indicators.
